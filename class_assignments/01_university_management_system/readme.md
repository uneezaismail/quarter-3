# ðŸŽ“ University Management System â€” OOP in Python

This project is a simple simulation of a university management system built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python.  
It was created as part of an assignment to learn and apply core OOP principles.

---

##  Objective

The goal of this project was to implement key OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and object interaction by simulating real-world relationships between students, instructors, courses, and departments.

---

##  Features

-  **Base Class - Person**  
  Contains shared attributes like `name` and `age`.

-  **Student Class (inherits from Person)**  
  Stores student-specific data like `rollNumber` and handles course registration.

-  **Instructor Class (inherits from Person)**  
  Manages instructor-specific data like `salary` and course assignment.

-  **Course Class**  
  Maintains enrolled students and assigned instructor.

-  **Department Class**  
  Allows grouping of multiple courses under one academic department.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Practiced

- Object-Oriented Programming
- Inheritance and Constructor Overriding
- Using `super()` to call parent class methods
- Class interactions and object communication
- Code modularity and structure
