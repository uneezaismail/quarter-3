# Problem #1: List Practice
# Now practice writing code with lists! Implement the functionality described in the comments below.

# def main(): # Create a list called fruit_list that contains the following fruits: # 'apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'pineapple'.



def main():
    fruit_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'pineapple']

    print("Length of fruit_list:", len(fruit_list))

    fruit_list.append('mango')

    print("Updated fruit_list:", fruit_list)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
