# Implement the helper function make_sentence(word, part_of_speech) which will take a string word and an integer part_of_speech as parameters and, depending on the part of speech, place the word into one of three sentence templates (or one from your imagination!):

# If part_of_speech is 0, we will assume the word is a noun and use the template: "I am excited to add this ____ to my vast collection of them!"

# If part_of_speech is 1, we will assume the word is a verb use the template: "It's so nice outside today it makes me want to ____!"

# If part_of_speech is 2, we will assume the word is an adjective and use the template: "Looking out my window, the sky is big and ____!" make_sentence(word, part_of_speech) should not return anything, just print the correct sentence with the word filled in the blank.
