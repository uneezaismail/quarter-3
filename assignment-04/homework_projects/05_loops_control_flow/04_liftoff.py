# Write a program that prints out the calls for a spaceship that is about to launch. Countdown from 10 to 1 and then output Liftoff!

# Here's a sample run of the program:

# 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Liftoff!

# There are many ways to solve this problem. One approach is to use a for loop, and to use the for loop variable i. Recall that i will keep track of how many times the for loop has completed executing its body.


def spaceship_countdown():
    for i in range(10, 0, -1):
        print(i, end=" ")  

    print("Liftoff!")
