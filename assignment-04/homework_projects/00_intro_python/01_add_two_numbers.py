# Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. The program should perform the following tasks:

# Prompt the user to enter the first number.
# Read the input and convert it to an integer.
# Prompt the user to enter the second number.
# Read the input and convert it to an integer.
# Calculate the sum of the two numbers.
# Print the total sum with an appropriate message.


first_number = int(input("Enter your first number = "))
second_number = int(input("Enter your second number = "))
sum_of_numbers = first_number + second_number

print(f"\nThe sum of your numbers is {sum_of_numbers}.")
