# a public variable name,
# a protected variable _salary, and
# a private variable __ssn.
# Try accessing all three variables from an object of the class and document what happens.

class Employee:

    def __init__(self):
        self.employee_name = "Ronaldo"      # Public variable
        self._employee_salary = 1000         # Protected variable
        self.__employee_ssn = "123-45-6789"   # Private variable


emp = Employee()


print(emp.employee_name)    # public: accessible

print(emp._employee_salary) # protected: accessible but use carefully
